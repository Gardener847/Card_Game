# Card Game

This is a simple card game, in which you win by trying to match all the cards, while trying to get as much points as you can. When flipping two cards, if they're a match, you gain a point and they remain flipped. Otherwise, the cards are automatically flipped back. There is a single player and two player mode.

### NOTE!
If you chose mistmatching cards, wait for them to flip back before clicking additional cards. Also, the "All" option is a little buggy.
